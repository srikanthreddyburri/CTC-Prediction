# CTC-Prediction
 Using machine learning techniques, we aim to build a robust regression model to accurately estimate CTC values.
Features:
--->Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.)
--->Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
--->Outlier detection and handling
--->Feature selection for better model performance
--->Model comparison: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regressor
--->Hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance
--->Final deployment-ready model with detailed evaluation metrics
Technologies Used:
--->Python
--->Libraries:
       pandas
       numpy
       matplotlib
       seaborn
       scikit-learn
Workflow:
--->Ensure all the dependencies are installed.
--->Load the dataset (data.csv) into the data/ folder.
--->Execute the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to preprocess, train, and evaluate the models.
--->The final model and results are saved in the output/ folder.

Future Improvements:
--->Incorporate advanced regression techniques like XGBoost and LightGBM.
--->Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI for real-time predictions.
--->Improve feature engineering by exploring domain-specific insights.
--->Add cross-validation for robust model evaluation.
